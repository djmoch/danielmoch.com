description: News of American society's decline

It has become commonplace to discuss with a certain level of anxiety
the decline of American society.
I hear this sort of talk from folks on both sides of the political
aisle.
More germaine to what I wish to discuss today, I also hear this
talk from folks of all sorts of religious persuasions, including
no religous persuation at all.
It's my belief that, while the discussion itself is certainly valid
and important, the anxiety surrounding it is largely unhelpful.

To lay my cards on the table up front, I write this as a Christian
believer in the Reformed tradition.
My tradition takes it's name from the Reformation of the Sixteenth
Century, and we trace many of our theological distinctives back to
that time.
One of the central theological distinctives of Reformed Christians
is the thoroughgoing commitment to the sovereignty of God, the
belief that God is all-powerful.
The Reformed commitment to the sovereignty of God is thoroughgoing
insofar as it operates as a basic smell-test for theological
doctrines.
If a certain doctrine requires the sovereignty of God to be somehow
qualified, Reformed Christians are certain to reject it.

If we accept the Reformed view that the Christian God's sovereignty,
his all-powerfulness is not to be challenged, then it must be true
that he is sovereign over such things as the rise and fall of
nations, and indeed all of human history.

(To be sure, this raises all sorts of knotty questions about how
evil can exist in a world under the sovereignty of a God who is
both Good *and* all-powerful.
Those are important questions, but not ones I mean to address here.)

If we accept all of this, then it must be true that what is happening
today in America is not out of God's control.
That should be some comfort to Christians who believe (as many of
the folks I talk with appear to) that the general trend of American
society is not good.
