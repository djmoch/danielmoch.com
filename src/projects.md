Projects
========

Here's a list of things I'm working on in my personal time.

- [Vim MakeJob](https://git.danielmoch.com/vim-makejob.git/about)

  Minimal, asynchronous Quickfix commands for Vim 8.

  I'm abnormally passionate about Vim (although you won't see me
  starting any holy wars with Emacs users). This is my small
  contribution to hopefully make it a little better for everyone.

- [CBR Schedule](https://git.danielmoch.com/cbr-schedule.git/about)

  A utility to configure and generate Bible reading plans in a variety
  of formats. If you attend [NewCity
  Orlando](http://newcityorlando.com) or one of the other churchs that
  participates in Community Bible Reading (CBR) and you're looking for
  the PDF version of this year's plan, you can download that
  [here](/static/cbr.pdf).

  Incidentally, I'm a big fan of the [Python](https://python.org)
  programming language, which I've used to create this utility.

- [NextCloud Notes Command Line Interface (nncli)](https://git.danielmoch.com/nncli.git/about)

  A fork of [sncli](https://github.com/insanum/sncli) that works with
  the NextCloud Notes app. Features a terminal user interface (TUI)
  mode and multiple command-line switches for scripting.

- [Hookmeup](https://git.danielmoch.com/hookmeup.git/about)

  An installable Git hook to automate your Pipenv and Django
  workflows. Will automatically clean and sync your Pipenv-managed
  virtualenv and migrate your Django database whenever you perform a
  Git checkout or pull to your local repository.

- [Vim Runtime](https://git.danielmoch.com/vim-runtime.git/about)

  I maintain several runtime files distributed with the
  [Vim](http://vim.org) text editor. If for some reason you need to
  download these files individually (e.g., maybe you're running an
  outdated version of Vim), then you can access them via the above
  link.

- [Arch Linux User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=djmoch)

  After over ten years as an avid MacOS user, I have recently made the
  leap to Linux, where I've settled on [Arch
  Linux](https://archlinux.org) as my distribution of choice. I'm also
  beginning to interact with the user community there, and one way I'm
  doing that is by maintaining several packages on the Arch Linux User
  Repository (AUR). Click in the AUR link above to navigate to my user
  profile over there. There are also a variety of less mature Arch
  PKGBUILDs on my [personal Git site](https://git.danielmoch.com).
