<p>
I am a <span class="p-job-title">Software Engineer and
Architect</span> who has been active in the industry since
2005. I have experience developing in real-time operating
systems, embedded Linux device drivers, and automated factory
acceptance testing. Since 2009 I have focused mainly on
information and logistics systems.
<p>
Most of my time professionally is spent maintaining legacy
code. As a result, I have developed a specialty applying
DevOps practices to older codebases, and since 2019 I have
split my time doing this across multiple internal projects.
<p>
In 2024 I began working with the open source community in
the area of security.
