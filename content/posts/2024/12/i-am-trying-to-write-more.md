My wife will tell you that in the past I have taken an all-or-nothing
approach to social media.
I cannot say I like that, since I prefer to take a thoughtful
approach to things.
Thoughfulness and absolutes make an odd couple, and so with the new
year it seems like a good time to reflect, in writing, on how I am
using and plan to use social media in this next season of life.

## Past

To review where I am coming from, apart from the occasional foray
into the [Fediverse] I have not had an active social media presence
since maybe 2017.
LinkedIn is arguably an exception, but during that time even my
account there was mostly dormant.

That began to change this past summer when I opened public accounts on
Mastodon and Bluesky.
This followed me [shutting down my self-hosting presence], and
looking back it seems fair to say the implicit logic was that, if
I was no longer self-hosting my code repositories and personal data,
then why not jump back into the mix and see how things have progressed.
If it also gave me the chance to reconnect with past friends, so
much the better.

I did indeed reconnect with some old friends, which has been great.
But as so often happens, I ended up learning as much about myself
as anything else.
For starters, it seems clear now that my constitution will not
permit me to have something like social media available to me at
all times without becoming like a rat hitting a feeder bar.
Second, most of the conversation on microblogging sites in particular
is designed to be ephemeral, and that's fine.
But it doesn't really work for me.
I can't help feeling like the sort of off-the-cuff post I might
make on Bluesky is tonally mismatched with the permanence of the
Internet.
I've seen too many people get a *lot* of negative attention for
saying something thoughtless, and I know that there but for the
grace of God go I.
While you might find recent examples of me cracking wise or pointing
out bitter, modern ironies, you will see it very rarely from me
going forward.

## Present

That brings us up to today.
I have accounts on a handfull of other sites.
Some accounts I've already deleted again.
All told, though, I'm looking to re-orient my time online toward
writing more, and more often.

There are some [IndieWeb] principles that I intend to put into
practice to help make this happen.
The most relevant of these is [POSSE] or "Publish (on your) Own
Site, Syndicate Elsewhere."
In other words, every post that seems worth posting on social media
will first be posted to this site, and then (usually?) linked from
my other accounts.

[IndieWeb]: https://indieweb.org
[POSSE]: https://indieweb.org/POSSE

The way I see this helping is by introducing some friction.
While it is entirely possible to automate the syndication process,
I still maintain a static website.
I considered adding a dynamic backend to automate the syndication,
and even had the beginnings of an architecture drawn up, but my
heart wasn't in it.
Then I realized this could work in my favor by forcing me to slow
down before I post.
So for now I'm considering the manual effort involved in posting a
feature rather than a bug.

And the manual effort is not trivial either.
Posting is effectively a three-step process:

1. Create and publish the post on this website
2. Syndicate to my social media accounts
3. Add social media links to the original post and re-publish

## Future

If I get to a point where I haved tamed the pull social media has
on me then I might revisit adding a backend to support automated
syndication.
A middle ground option to automate would be to use a paid service
like [Micro.blog].

As I've said already, the point of this is to write more.
It seems necessary, in order to do that, for my to dial down my
dependence on social media, even if I am not ready to abandon it
(again).
I have made a few other changes to my life in the past several
months.
My primary aim has been to be more present with my family, but I
hope it will make me more so with myself as well.
If that happens I would like to use that headspace to read, think
and write more.
That writing will primarily occur here, and in an ideal world will
have more substance than the half-formed thoughts I've occasionally
populated this blog with to date.

None of these are promises.
I won't even call them resolutions.
Consider these things I am hoping for in the new year.
