A couple years back I was introduced to some of the folks at [Galois],
and they convinced me that formal methods can lower the cost of
software development.
Now I'm reading [this post] from Marc Brooker where he adds a bit of
nuance that I think is helpful.
I'll summarize it this way: formal methods can lower the total cost
to develop and maintain system-level software, where the requirements
are stable and well-understood.
If you're designing a user-facing system and need to interatively
respond to customer feedback—in other words, if your requirements
are shifting and poorly understood—Agile remains the best choice.
