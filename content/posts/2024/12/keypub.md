[Keypub](https://keypub.sh) seems like the kind of thing that could
be really useful, and yet I find myself mildly pessimistic about
its prospects.
The biggest get would obviously be a forge provider like GitHub or
GitLab, but I don't see them adopting this anytime soon.

That said, it could perhaps be a nice signal for anyone looking to
build a reputation-based service for vetting open source contributors
and/or maintainers.
I haven't fully thought through how that might work, but having a
second source linking SSH public keys to email addresses seems like
it could be valuable.

At any rate, I'll be keeping my eye on this.
