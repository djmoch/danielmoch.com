The title, I'm sure, will offend people in at least two different
groups. The first will see it as an attempt to inflame an already
simmering conflict within American culture. The second will see it
as an attempt to make a very real and necessary conflict seem
unsavory. To the first group, let me assure you that I have no such
desire. I already think our public discourse in America has come
off the rails, and the last thing I would want is to further toxify
the conversation by raising passions further.

My response to the second group is a bit more complicated. The fact
is that I do not know what might come of my attempt to reframe our
present moment. Perhaps the ideal outcome would be that we would
continue to see conversations about race, equality, justice, and
the rest as critically important, while also admitting the need to
adjust how we engage in them. But I'm getting ahead of myself. If
I'm going to convince anyone of that, I first need to demonstrate
that it's true. So let me try to do that by way of two analogies.

The first analogy is that of marriage. I am not a marriage counselor,
but I know several, and the message I get from them pretty consistently
is that poor communication is behind many if not most of the problems
married couples experience. That poor communication can take many
forms, from hurt feelings to shouting matches, and from off-limits
topics to stalemate arguments that become a test of wills. What's
needed in these situations is for each partner to accept that the
other wants to make the marriage work, and to parlay that small
step toward one other into a healthier environment where honest,
patient, even vulnerable conversation can take place.

## Politics As Religion

The second analogy concerns the title of this post. I think it is
equally valid to view the current cultural-political climate in
America as a kind of holy war. We usually see holy wars as fought
over religious belief, and of course they are ... _usually_. But
what is religion if not a set of beliefs about ultimate reality[^tk]?
And what can we say about a country that seems at times on the brink
of civil war if not that perceive their sense of ultimate reality
as under threat?

That last paragraph is a bit abstract, so let me try to bring this
idea of ultimate reality down to earth. It is a truism that
human beings all try to seek The Good, however we each define it.
To the extent that's true, The Good is just another phrase for
ultimate reality. If The Good for you is your own wealth and
happiness, that's your ultimate reality; you're a hedonist. If your
notion of The Good is a more traditionally religious ideal like
the glory of the God of the Bible, then you're a Christian.

I submit that what we're seeing in American culture is the replacement
of traditionally religious notions of the good (which are more or
less gone from the public sphere) with political ones. That can be
tricky to see in part because one side of the political spectrum
regularly clothes itself in religious language. But it's easy to
see past that once you realize that the religious language is used
in service of political ends. "God bless America, and vote for me."
And if it's true that political notions of the good reign today over
religious ones, then it's just as accurate to say that politics has
become a replacement for religion. Call it the Church of American
Folk Religion.

It's important to note that, even though the political right is
more prone to clothe itself in religious language, the left is no
less susceptible to this. If the left has been marked by anything
in the past few years, it's an identity politics that defines "the
good" as each individual's right to be recognized for however they
choose to define themselves. My only point here is that&mdash;good
or bad&mdash;this is something that seems to have reached the
status of a religious ideal.

## How To Avoid A Holy War

We all seek our notion of The Good. But when we define The Good in
political terms, we risk political disagreement becoming a holy
war. The American Founding Fathers were able to put aside religious
disagreement (at a time when such disagreements would often devolve
into violence), to create a country where the political process
replaced raw power with discourse&mdash;conversation, persuasion,
and, yes, impassioned debate. That discourse intended to be carried
out with the belief that the good they sought wasn't identical with
The Good (these were for the most part religious men, after all).

Can we emulate their example today?

[^tk]: I'm paraphrasing Timothy Keller, a Christian pastor in New York City who has written extensively on modern forms of worship.
