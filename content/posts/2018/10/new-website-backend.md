description: I've moved from a Django site to a static one powered by Nikola
---
**Update: As of July 2024 I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)**

For those interested, I've converted this website over from a
[Django](https://djangoproject.com) backend to
[Nikola](https://getnikola.com). Since there aren't any interactive
features on this site, it's clear that an engine such a Django was
overkill and that Nikola's static generator was a better option. So
far, so good. I especially appreciate being able to choose a
templating engine (I went with [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org), since
it was most like Django's templating engine).

If you notice anything weird or broken with the site, please hit me up
on one of the social media links on the landing page.

Cheers!
