Things I'm Thankful For When Traveling
--------------------------------------

- Online check-in and ticketing

- Random acts of kindness to help calm a screaming toddler

- Regarding above: The Netflix series Llama Llama

- Also regarding above: The children's series Paw Patrol

- Car rentals with CarPlay support, and that Apple finally got it's
  crap together re: Maps

- Staying with family rather than at a hotel

- A toddler sleeping mid-flight

- Getting to show my family new places or, as the case may be, places
  that are old to me but new to them

- The folks I'll get to see at the destination

- People watching on the way

Things I Would Prefer Be Different When Traveling
-------------------------------------------------

- Lackadaisical bag-check attendants, who one might think are duty bound
  to not care about people's boarding times, etc.

- The feeling of panic between when your toddler starts screaming like a
  banshee and when the aforementioned acts of kindness are perpetrated
  by various other passengers/Good Samaritans

- The mild sense dehumanization that accompanies any trip through the
  TSA line, but especially the ones with long waits and grumpy uniforms

- Turbulence

- That heartless master, the airplane seatbelt light

- $4 cans of soda

- However much a well drink costs mid-flight (I won't pay it unless the
  Mrs. tells me that I'm being insufferable and I should have a drink
  for her sake)

- My own crankiness and overall unpleasantness toward others, especially
  my wife
