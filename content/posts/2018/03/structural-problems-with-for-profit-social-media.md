description: Zeynep Tufekci nails the structural problems with social media

Many of you who know me personally know that I've become increasingly
concerned with online privacy over the past few years. It's a topic that
is near and dear to my heart, because I think the privacy, including
online privacy, is very important to a healthy civic life. I hope to
write a lot more about that going forward, but for now I want to
introduce you to someone whose work I'm only beginning to dig into
myself, but who has an awful lot of really smart things to say on the
topic of online privacy (among other things): Zeynep Tufekci.

I spare you my attempt at a mini-biography, mostly because I'm about
the least qualified person in the world to deliver. Rather, I'll point
you to this [TED
talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/zeynep_tufekci_we_re_building_a_dystopia_just_to_make_people_click_on_ads)
that she did October of last year where she talks about the
infrastructure that companies like Facebook and YouTube control and
how much they're able to do with the data they collect on us.

Here are a couple of quotes a took down as I was listening:

- It's not that the people that run Facebook or Google are maliciously
  and deliberately trying to make the world more polarized and encourage
  extremism. ... But it's not the intent and the statements that [these
  folks] are making that matter; it's the structures and the business
  models they are building.
- Either Facebook is a half-a-trillion dollar con and ads don't work on
  the site ... or it's power of influence is of great concern.

Her prescription seems on point: "We need a digital economy where our
data and our attention is not for sale to the highest bidding
authoritarian or demagogue." That's actually just the sound-bite
synopsis of her more nuanced call for businesses, consumers, and
governments all to work together to determine what our collective vision
is for all of the algorithmic magic (read: artificial intelligence)
underlying these systems, how they should operate, and the moral systems
that ultimately must be coded into them.

Evangelical Christians in the circles I run in have begun in the past
few years to seriously confront the fact that cultural structures often
exist to keep the powerful in power. I think a lot of us are going to
have to take a look at what has grown out of the combination of free
markets and the internet have caused to grow up, and then have a very
serious discussion about what might need to change.
