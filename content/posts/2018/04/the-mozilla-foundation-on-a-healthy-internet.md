description: Mozilla's report calls out Web illiteracy as a major problem

Sean Gallagher over at Ars Technica
[reported](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/04/mozilla-foundation-report-details-decline-in-health-of-internet)
yesterday on the 2018 [Internet Health
Report](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/), which Mozilla puts
together. I'm linking the article in addition to the report itself
because Sean does such a great job summarizing it. Of course I also
think the Report itself is important, and I particularly like the
metrics it uses to gauge how healthy the Internet is.

Gallagher summarizes the report's concerns this way:

   Of particular concern were three issues:

   - Consolidation of power over the Internet, particularly by Facebook,
     Google, Tencent, and Amazon.
   - The spread of "fake news," which the report attributes in part to
     the "broken online advertising economy" that provides financial
     incentive for fraud, misinformation, and abuse.
   - The threat to privacy posed by the poor security of the Internet of
     Things.

I'd point out that the Report itself alludes to another concern, and
it's one that I hope to give a lot of attention to in my writing here,
and that's the topic of Web literacy. As I hope to explain in future
posts, I think there's a reciprocal relationship between the problems
above and Web literacy, which is to say the problems above are both made
worse by Web *illiteracy*, and at the same time make Web illiteracy
worse.

For now I'll put that out there as food for thought.
