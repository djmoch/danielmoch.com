After about a ... *checks notes* ... 13-year hiatus, I have started
maintaining my [Goodreads profile] again.
If I have learned anything from the experience, it is that I have
started and subsequently *not* finished a lot of books.
Looking back this is almost always the result of a lack of discipline
on my part, and not due to the fact that I particularly did not
enjoy any of them, much less that I disliked them.
So I am going to start going through these books more intentionally.
