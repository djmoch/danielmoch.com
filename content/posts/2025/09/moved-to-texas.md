This won't be news to anyone I have spoken to over the past few
weeks, but my family and I have relocated from Greater Orlando to
the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.
It is a good career move for me, but what sealed the deal was my
family's excitement about moving to the area.
Orlando had treated us well, and we are leaving behind a lot of
close friends, but overall there is a lot of optimism that DFW will
feel like home before long.

If you're in the area, reach out and let me know.
It would be great to make some connections in the area!
