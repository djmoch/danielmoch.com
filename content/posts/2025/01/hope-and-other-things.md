I was going through my journal from 2024 as part of a planning
activity for 2025, and I came across this one-line entry:

> My perfectionism stems from a borderline terror response to shame.

It is true that I have struggled with perfectionism as far back as
I can remember.
What I find fascinating about this entry is how simply, even
beautifully it connects my perfectionism (which I have known about
for a long time) to something just a pervasive but which I have
only recently become aware: shame.

My experience of shame is as resistance to admitting uncomfortable
things about myself, *to* myself.
And given this reality, overcoming shame involves doing just that,
which is of course uncomfortable.
Discomfort, I have found, often comes from a sense of having fallen
short of some sort of expectation, having "missed the mark."
It is interesting, then, that this is also a commonly cited meaning
of sin[^si], and that sin is also often coupled to shame in the
Bible.
If we are talking about shame in terms of sin, perhaps we should
bring in the related concept of temptation as well.

[^si]: No biblical definition of sin would be complete without the
   notion of violating God's moral law, but for our purposes today
   we can set that aside.

## Temptation To Shame

My point in bringing sin and temptation into a discussion about
shame is to point out the reality that shame, in my experience, is
not something I am subjected to, but something I choose.
In other words, I am *tempted* to feel shame over something, and
subsequently *choose* or agree with it.
I have arrived at this conclusion after spending a lot of time—and
not a little money—in therapy dealing with depression and anger.
This process took as long as it did because, as the above journal
entry implies, I have mostly experienced subconsciously with the
result of driving me toward perfectionism.
Being subconscious, it was easy to distract myself from it.

But if shame is something that I am tempted to do, then I have the
opportunity to reject it, no?
Indeed, I believe I do.

## Rejecting Temptation To Shame

When feeling tempted to shame, I have found it helps to first
identify what is triggering you in that situation.
For me the usual triggers are: feeling powerless, out-of-control,
or otherwise experiencing a sense of futility; feeling alone,
abandoned, or betrayed; or feeling an unusual level of stress.

After identifying the active trigger(s) in a given situation, I next respond
to the temptation by exploring it.
Part of what is important here is not suppressing or ignoring the
discomfort.
That path leads to anxiety.
I realize this might sound a bit squishy—even woo-woo—but the goal
here is very practical: self-understanding.
The exploration might bring to light healthy ways to meet an
underlying need, assuming the trigger says something true about
you.

Understand that the desired outcome of this activity is awareness,
not the elimination of the temptation.
It is the awareness that empowers you to reject shame.
It becomes almost as easy as saying no.

## Conclusion

This post has been a personal reflection on my journey from
perfectionism, depression and anger, through anxiety, to a place
of relative health.
The animating force of those negative emotions and experiences has
been shame.
I am thankful to say that today I can look back with gratitude on
the things I have experienced, even when they have been tremendously
painful.

If you have made it this far, then I would like to think something
above has resonated with you.
If it is because you also deal with depression and shame, then I
hope you will seek out the help you need.
We are social creatures, not meant to go through hard times alone.

May we all find ways to accept the things about ourselves we wish
were different.
