Last night I started reading *The Hobbit* to my children, and they
went to pieces as I read the following exchange:

> "Good morning!" said Bilbo, and he meant it.
> The sun was shining, and the grass was very green.
> But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that
> stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.
>
> "What do you mean?" he said.
> "Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning
> whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or
> that it is a morning to be good on?"
>
> "All of them at once," said Bilbo.

I also think it is a funny passage.
I am not really going anywhere with this.
I just think it is nice having kids old enough to appreciate some
of the same things you do.
I am here for this new phase of being a parent!
