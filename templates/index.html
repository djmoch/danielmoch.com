<h2><a class="subtle-link" href="/posts/2019/07/using-qemu-without-pulling-your-hair-out/">Using QEMU Without Pulling Your Hair Out</a></h2>
<div>
<p>I make it a rule to choose my tools carefully and to invest the time to learn
them deeply. QEMU has been one of those tools that I've wanted to learn how to
use for a long time, but was always a bit intimidated. I actually had been able
to use it indirectly via libvirt, but it felt like I was cheating my rule by
using one tool to manage another. Despite my vague sense of guilt, things
continued this way until I read a recent(ish) <a class="reference external" href="https://drewdevault.com/2018/09/10/Getting-started-with-qemu.html">introductory post on QEMU</a> by
Drew DeVault. The article is well written (as per usual for DeVault), and you'd
do well to read it before continuing here. The point is that it was the kick in
the pants I needed to finally roll up my sleeves and learn some QEMU.</p>

<p>I first came to Vim by recommendation. I was looking for a good Python
IDE (at the time I was new to the language) and one recommendation was
to use Vim with a variety of plugins added on top. That Vim could do a
lot of the things I thought only an IDE could do came as a bit of a
shock. I spent a summer as an intern using Emacs at a Unix terminal, but
didn't have enough curiosity at the time to use it any differently from
<code class="docutils literal">notepad.exe</code>. I spent that summer wishing I had automatic features for
completion, indentation, and all the things that made me appreciate
the IDE's I used in college.  How naive I was!</p>

<h2><a class="subtle-link" href="/posts/2018/11/zsh-compinit-rtfm/">Zsh Compinit ... RTFM</a></h2>
<div>
<p>This week I dealt with a problem that had been bugging me. I noticed
that the time a took to start a new <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zsh.org">Zsh</a> terminal session went from
essentially instant to around 4 seconds <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="/posts/2018/11/zsh-compinit-rtfm/#id5" id="id1">1</a>. I take some pride in running a
lightweight system, so the thought of having to wait a few seconds for
my terminal emulator to display a prompt feels like a personal affront.
My system wasn't just behaving badly, it was challenging me by way of
insult.</p>
<p>Accepting the challenge laid before me, I took to <a class="reference external" href="https://duckduckgo.com">my favorite search
engine</a> to see what tools were available to help me understand what was
suddenly performing so poorly. Oh, okay. <a class="reference external" href="https://xebia.com/blog/profiling-zsh-shell-scripts/">This post</a> says that Zsh
includes a script profiler. All I need to do is turn it on in my
<code class="docutils literal">.zshrc</code> file, like so:</p>

<h2><a class="subtle-link" href="/posts/2018/10/getting-started-on-mastodon/">Getting Started On Mastodon</a></h2>
<div>
<p>If I've identified a trend in my social media preferences, it's that I
prefer not to use social media. That's not to say that I <em>don't</em> use it,
just that I often feel conflicted when I do. On the one hand, this is
where my friends are, and online networks have become a sort of
pseudo-public square. (My choice of words there is deliberate ...
"pseudo" as in "fake." I actually don't think online networks work as a
true replacement for a public square, but that's a post for another
time.) Skip out on social media altogether and you basically opt-out of
a lot of opportunities to rub elbows with people, which, despite all of
the good and the bad that entails, I still think is worthwhile.</p>
<p>On the other hand, popular social networks are for-profit companies that
invariably make their money by turning their users into their product,
which is packaged and sold to online advertisers. I don't know about
you, but to me that feels a bit dehumanizing. Sure, that model of
business existed long before social networks did, at least in the
abstract, but let's not kid ourselves—the way we're packaged and sold to
advertisers is far different in the hands of social networks than at any
time in history. Magazines and television networks could guess at the
kinds of readers and viewers they attracted, and companies like Nielson
could even provide some hard data to back up their guesswork, but what
they didn't have was gobs of very personal data from which to draw
conclusions about us. Apart from our reading/viewing habits, older forms
of media had comparatively little to work with.</p>

<h2><a class="subtle-link" href="/posts/2018/10/new-website-backend/">New Website Backend</a></h2>
<div>
<p>For those interested, I've converted this website over from a <a class="reference external" href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a>
backend to <a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com">Nikola</a>. Since there aren't any interactive features on this
site, it's clear that an engine such a Django was overkill and that
Nikola's static generator was a better option. So far, so good. I
especially being able to choose a templating engine (I went with
<a class="reference external" href="http://jinja.pocoo.org">Jinja</a>, since it was most like Django's templating engine).</p>
<p>If you notice anything weird or broken with the site, please hit me up
on one of the social media links on the landing page.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
